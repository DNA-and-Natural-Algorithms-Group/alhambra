Alhambra File Format
====================


Introduction
------------

Alhambra uses a unified, `YAML-based <yaml.org>`__ file format for both
its input and output, and for describing tile systems from an abstract
level to an experiment-ready sequence level.

This format can be written and modified by hand, and can also be
generated and modified through Alhambra or other programmatic methods.
Alhambra uses `ruamel.yaml <https://bitbucket.org/ruamel/yaml>`__ for
loading and saving YAML files, which should result in comments being
preserved.

Alhambra’s file format is currently designed to store the following
information:

-  Tile descriptions (name, structure, labels, sticky ends, sequences,
   etc)
-  End descriptions (name, type, orientation, sequence)
-  Origami seed descriptions (type, adapters)
-  Xgrow parameters
-  Generation information (sequence design parameters for ends, tiles,
   etc - a log of what Alhambra has done)

Other information can easily be added by adding extra key/value pairs.

The top level of the YAML file should be a mapping. Alhambra recognizes
the following key/value pairs:

-  tiles: a list of tiles
-  ends: a list of sticky ends
-  seed: a mapping describing the seed
-  info: a mapping of system information
-  FIXME

tiles
-----

The value attached to the tile key should be a YAML sequence. Each
sequence item should be a mapping, with the following keys recognized by
Alhambra:

-  name: (required, or one will be generated by Alhambra) the name of
   the tile. This should be a name that is compatible with
   peppercompiler’s component naming restrictions.
-  structure: (required) FIXME
-  ends: a YAML sequence of end names. Complements should be indicated
   with / at the end of the name.
-  label:
-  color: a color for Xgrow and diagrams FIXME.
-  strands: a YAML sequence of strand sequence strings.
