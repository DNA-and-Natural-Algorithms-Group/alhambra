# Tasks

* Clean up old code. I don't think endreorder.py is used at
  all. tileutils.py is probably mostly or entirely replaced
  by tiletypes.py. Other bits of the included code are
  probably pretty bad.
* Add documentation.
* Add both a test suite for testing changes, and checks
  throughout to test consistency and quality of sets during
  design.
